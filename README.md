Solution for Java Unit studios 4.8 and 5.6

If I make updates to the original repo and you've forked and cloned it previously, take the following steps to update your local copy with my changes:

```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/Carolista/java-restaurant-menu-review
> git fetch upstream
```

Now you just need to merge in the changes from the upstream (original) repo locally, and then push the changes to your forked remote repo.

From the `main` branch:

```
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```
